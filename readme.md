## Installation

Nosviak2 utilizes a MySQL database for storing data for its clients, this means you will have to
install MySQL-server and setup and create your database and a database user for the cnc to access
via.


### MySQL install for **Ubuntu 20.04**

 - As of Nosviak2 v1.2 the cnc will automatically create your database tables so
 - you only need to install, Config & Create the database as Nosviak2 will do the rest.

    1. Install       `sudo apt install mysql-server`
    2. Start         `sudo systemctl start mysql.service`
    3. Configure     `sudo mysql_secure_installation`
    4. Open MySQL    `sudo mysql`
    5. Create DB     `CREATE DATABASE Nos2;`
    6. Open DB       `USE Nos2;`
 
 - We will now attempt to create the database user for the cnc to access and grant privileges
 - to manage, create & delete users.
    
    7. Create        `CREATE USER 'nosviak2_client'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'vKeXAorBwnBQPk3QG83BeB7ncO7WGjWT';`
    8. Grant perms   `GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON * . * TO 'nosviak2_client'@'localhost';`
    9. Update        `FLUSH PRIVILEGES;`

 - Now we much set the configuration options for the database which nosviak2 loads
 - from and parses the information for opening the connection with the database
    indication **1** [location](../assets/config.json) 
    ```json
    "database" : {
        "name" : "Nos2",
        "username" : "nosviak2_client",
        "password" : "vKeXAorBwnBQPk3QG83BeB7ncO7WGjWT",
        "host" : "localhost:3306"
    }, 
    ```
